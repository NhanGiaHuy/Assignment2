This is a tron bike java program.

Run the main menu to get the application to start working. 

It has a single player and two player mode.

Use the arrow buttons to move the lightcycle.

For the two players, use the "W", "A", "S", "D" and key arrows to move.

The game will stop when the lightcycle hits the boundaries of the frame, hit itself 
or the second player.

The highscore will only be updated for the single player, after ending the single 
player mode.
